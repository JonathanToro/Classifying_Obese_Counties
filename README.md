# Classifying Obese Counties
## Project that uses supervised learning methods to classify counties based on obesity rate

The goal of this project is to predict the obesity rates of the counties with missing obesity rates. Around 30% of the counties don't have an obesity rate. The data was extracted from Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) database. The minimal app is the flask app created to visualize the obesity rates throughout America. I used supervised learning methods such logistic regression, random forests, and other models to classify whether a county was above or below the median obesity rate. The jupyter notebook in this repo shows all of my work on this project.
